#Simple Shell
This is a simple shell program developed as part of the ALX Software Engineering program. The shell supports basic command execution and some built-in commands.

Features
Executes external commands by forking a child process.
Supports input and output redirection using < and > operators.
Implements basic built-in commands such as exit, cd, and env.
Handles background processes using the & operator.
Provides a prompt for user input.
Supports command line arguments.
